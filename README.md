<h1>CAMPFIRE CAMPUS README.MD</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Campus Campfire is a site allowing college students to connect, create  events and leave their reviews on them. Students are also able to indicate that they will attend an event, and give it a star rating.

<img src='./ReadmeFiles/ReadmeImages/amiresponsive.png' alt='Responsiveness image of site, displayed on multiple devices.'>

The live site is deployed on Heroku [here](https://campus-campfire-d6ae0237c555.herokuapp.com/).

## Site Development
This site was developed using an Agile methodology, with a focus on getting a minimum viable product in place first before adding further features. User stories were sorted using MoSCoW prioritisation, and GitHub projects was used for the project board. An image of this at the end of the project can be seen below.

<img src='./ReadmeFiles/ReadmeImages/project_board.png' alt='Project board'>

User experience was considered throughout the development process in order to give a cohesive feel.

## Landing page for first time users

The landing page allows users to see a display with all upcoming events, including details such as how many students are attending. Users are unable to indicate that they will attend an event until they have registered as a student and logged in.

Users can see the site logo at the top of the page in bright blue with a navbar under it that contains the main sections of the site: Home, Register and Login. At the bottom of the page the user can find the footer with the names of the developers who worked together on this project. 

<strong>Landing page for first time users</strong>

## Home page (Site Logo)

The first element that the user sees when visiting site, is the logo: Campfire Campus in big, bright blue font. 

- User experience in the Logo section: 

  - The selection of size, colour and type of font, 
 helps the user to identify quickly the name of the site.

  - The name of the site "Campfire Campus" indicates clearly that this is a website related with the academic world. In addition, the name indicates that it is a place for socialising and students are welcomed. 
  
  - Thanks to the Logo the user would feel comfortable and with a positive attitude even before checking the rest of the page.

## Home page (Events) 

The Home page focuses mainly on the display of the events, as mentioned above. Each event is enclosed in a black square to differentiate it from the rest of events. The main features that can be highlighted are:

- The name of the event is as well a clickable button for the user. 

- Under the event name, the user can see the location, the date, and the creator of the event each one with a descriptive icon.  

- On the top right corner, the user can see the number of available spots and the number of participants attending with icon next to it. 

- Finally, on the bottom right corner there is a clickable button for those students who want to indicate that they will attend.
  - This button displays as "Register" for non-authenticated users, alongside a prompt explaining that they must register & create a student profile in order to attend. Clicking the button will direct them to the registration page.

- User experience in the events section: 

  - The selection of size, colour and type of font, 
 helps the user to identify quickly the name of the event and the button for registering.
 
  - The icons give important visual information about the event (location, date, author, number of participants) and help the user to navigate through the information provided.

  - The colour of the attending icon helps it stand out on the page.
  
  - The clickable button is easy  to identify, as it stands alone on the right corner, besides it gives straight and intuitive access to the new user who wants to register for an upcoming event. It also grows and changes the cursor when hovered over to add to this.

<strong>Home page Events section</strong>

<img src="./ReadmeFiles/ReadmeImages/homepage_event.png" alt="Home page Events section">


## Home page (Navbar and foooter) 

Apart from the events section the Home page also provides the user with a useful navbar and an informative footer. The navbar is divided into three main areas of interest: Home, Register and Login and the footer proportionate information of interest about the developers that collaborated on this project. Once the user is logged in the navbar links change to Home, My Events, Profile and Logout. The main features that can be highlighted are:

- The clickable sections in both, the navbar and the footer 

- The colour animation when the user hovers over the clickable parts.

- The change in the cursor icon when the user hovers over the clickable parts.

- User experience in the navbar and footer section: 

  - The selection of size, colour and type of font, 
 helps the user to identify quickly the different sections that can be found on the navbar.

  - The colour transition animation in the navbar and the footer, as well as the change in the cursor icon, both give clear indications about the clickable property of the elements in these sections. Besides, they produce an eye-catching effect on the user when these elements are hovered over, creating the need for clicking and a sense of mystery.

  - The Git hub cat icon in the footer,  gives important visual information about the names, as it makes explicit their contribution as developers in the project.

## Authentication

The allauth package was used to implement authentication for this site, and the templates adapted to fit the site theme. Users are able to sign up (register), log in and log out.

## Design Choices

### Fonts 

IntroRust was chosen as a more interesting font that would give character to the page. It was sourced from [here](https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/fontfabric/intro-rust-free?utm_source=fontsquirrel.com&utm_medium=download_link&utm_campaign=intro-rust#firstfreeproduct)

We selected the font style [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins). It's a sans serif font, so very clear and easy to read. Its popularity on the web gives it instant recognition as well.

We selected more plain and simple design with professional colours but a big, vibrant pop of pink as an accent. We derived our colours from [coolors](https://coolors.co/012765-d30cd5-003fa5-010100-f8fff4)

<div align="center">

</div>

### Wire Frames

The wireframes were constructed using Balsamiq in a group call to get feedback on all design choices. This was so front-end and back-end could be aligned even from the early stages to think of any pitfalls that could occur<br>

You can view the wireframes [here](./ReadmeFiles/Wireframes/CampusCampfire.pdf)

### Database

We planned our models beforehand to avoid having to do migrations mid-project. We established the field types, one-to-many, PK or FK etc. 

Here is an image of our ERD:

    <th>Resolution</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>User upload of images</td>
  <td>Images uploaded through the site profile or event creation pages were not being added to cloudinary and so weren't being reflected in the database or created profile/event.</td>
  <td>This was an issue with the setup of the cloudinary upload field. A workaround was found employing the cloudinary upload widget to upload the image and then using JavaScript to populate the image URL for display in the created profile/event. This will be improved in the next sprint to bring the image upload into the form itself, since the solution to the bug has now been found.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>"Attend" button for events does not change to reflect that a user is attending an event.</td>
  <td>The "Attend" button for each event on the home page should change to reflect that a signed-in user is attending.</td>
    
  <td>Fixed using JavaScript.</td>
  </tr>

### Validator Testing 

#### HTML
The [w3 validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate all pages. All passed with no errors other than those introduced by external packages:
  - crispy-forms in its rendering of textarea elements, which are outside of developer control. 
  - allauth: the signup page showed errors related to the html used to display the registration form, again outside of developer control.
<img src='./ReadmeFiles/ReadmeImages/html validation pass.png'>

#### CSS
The [W3C validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate the CSS written for the site. All of the developer-generated CSS passed with no errors, with the exception of some pseudo-classes used to generate hover effects on navbar items and buttons. However these work as intended and do not cause any issues.

<img src='./ReadmeFiles/ReadmeImages/css_validator.png'>

#### JavaScript
The JavaScript written for this website was passed through [jshint](https://jshint.com/) and found to contain no errors, with only advisory warnings about syntax available in ES6 being displayed.
